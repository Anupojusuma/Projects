I built this project as part of my Special project. It combines Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and web development into a single easy-to-use application.
* Aim
Predicts if a customer is likely to churn based on their service usage and account details. Lets users choose between 3 different models:

ii.Random Forest
iii. XGBoost
Provide a web interface (built using Flask) where anyone can input values and get predictions instantly.

* Tools and Technologies Used
 Python for data handling and model building
 TensorFlow, XGBoost, and scikit-learn for machine learning
 Flask for the backend
 HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Chart.js for the frontend
 SMOTE technique to balance the data
